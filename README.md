### Oh... Welcome ! ðŸ––

I'm **Ewan GravÃ©**, a french student in software engineering and computer science at Polytech Tours.

Meanwhile working on my projects, I'm also participating to some projects in student's associations, such as
- **P++**, the programming association of our school
- **La K'Fet**, the lunch room in which I make coffee during breaks â˜• ðŸ‘Œ

I'm mostly working with C++, Java, and HTML/CSS (and a little bit of PHP).
